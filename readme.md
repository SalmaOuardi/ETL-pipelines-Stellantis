  Data Pipelines for Stellantis Carflow Project

</h1>
 
#### Autor: Salma OUARDI

The **Carflow MEA Dashboards** project at Stellantis is a crucial initiative in the MEA region with the objective of utilizing data from **various sources** to monitor the supply chain operations in the MEA region. The current ETL process for extracting, transforming, and loading data into the data warehouse is **manual**, leading to _**increased efforts, the potential for human error, and inefficiencies**_. To address this challenge, Stellantis hired me as a data engineering intern to _**automate the ETL process and streamline the data management process**_ for the Carflow MEA Dashboards project.
